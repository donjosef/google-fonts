# Google fonts search engine

## Decription

Built with google fonts api. The get request is handled by axios. The response of the restful API is formatted in JSON and includes for each family a list of the styles available.
I managed the main logic with the response, building a filterable list when user types in, and the click event on every font that allows to inject a new google link stylesheet.
